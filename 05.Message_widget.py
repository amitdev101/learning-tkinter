# Message Widget

# The widget can be used to display short text messages. 
# The message widget is similar in its functionality to the Label widget, 
# but it is more flexible in displaying text, 
# e.g. the font can be changed while the Label widget can only display text in a single font. 
# It provides a multiline object, that is the text may span more than one line. 
# The text is automatically broken into lines and justified. 
# We were ambiguous, when we said, that the font of the message widget can be changed. 
# This means that we can choose arbitrarily a font for one widget, but the text of this widget will be rendered solely in this font. 
# This means that we can't change the font within a widget. So it's not possible to have a text in more than one font. 
# If you need to display text in multiple fonts, we suggest to use a Text widget.

# The syntax of a message widget:

# w = Message ( master, option, ... )

# Let's have a look at a simple example. The following script creates a message with a famous saying by Mahatma Gandhi:

import tkinter as tk
root = tk.Tk()
whatever_you_do = "Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.\n(Mahatma Gandhi)"
msg = tk.Message(root, text = whatever_you_do)
msg.config(bg='lightgreen', font=('times', 24, 'italic'))
msg.pack()
tk.mainloop()




# The Options in Detail
# Option 	    Meaning
# anchor 	    The position, where the text should be placed in the message widget: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or CENTER. The Default is CENTER.
# aspect 	    Aspect ratio, given as the width/height relation in percent. The default is 150, which means that the message will be 50% wider than it is high. Note that if the width is explicitly set, this option is ignored.
# background 	The background color of the message widget. The default value is system specific.
# bg 	        Short for background.
# borderwidth 	Border width. Default value is 2.
# bd 	        Short for borderwidth.
# cursor 	    Defines the kind of cursor to show when the mouse is moved over the message widget. By default the standard cursor is used.
# font 	        Message font. The default value is system specific.
# foreground 	Text color. The default value is system specific.
# fg 	        Same as foreground.
# highlightbackground 	Together with highlightcolor and highlightthickness, this option controls how to draw the highlight region.
# highlightcolor 	    See highlightbackground.
# highlightthickness 	See highlightbackground.
# justify 	            Defines how to align multiple lines of text. Use LEFT, RIGHT, or CENTER. Note that to position the text inside the widget, use the anchor option. Default is LEFT.
# padx 	                Horizontal padding. Default is -1 (no padding).
# pady 	                Vertical padding. Default is -1 (no padding).
# relief 	            Border decoration. The default is FLAT. Other possible values are SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, and RIDGE.
# takefocus 	        If true, the widget accepts input focus. The default is false.
# text 	                Message text. The widget inserts line breaks if necessary to get the requested aspect ratio. (text/Text)
# textvariable 	        Associates a Tkinter variable with the message, which is usually a StringVar. If the variable is changed, the message text is updated.
# width 	            Widget width given in character units. A suitable width based on the aspect setting is automatically chosen, if this option is not given.
